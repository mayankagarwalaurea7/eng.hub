  description: AL, support and other parties are still creating Eng Problems in JVCLD, which generates issues for visibility, as we are watching only tickets in JCLDALL.
  Move all tickets created in JVCLD to JCLDALL and remove write permissions for other people than PSEM + VP, to avoid this in the future
