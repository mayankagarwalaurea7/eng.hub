        unit: https://jira.devfactory.com/browse/EL-74
        coaching: Found that he is introducing parameters without explaining their meaning (i.e. he mention a directory to store properties file without telling that it can be any directory). Asked him to give an explanation (even if it seems obvious) for every parameterhe is introducing to E2E. Also, asked him to give examples of values if any specific format is expected.
