        coaching: Guided IC during review that this Code Does Unchecked Assignment and an improvement would be to add a diamond <> to the collection/map on the right side of the assignment to avoid an unchecked warning issued by the compiler.

        coaching: IC is guided on improving the JUnit Test Method Name as prefix is specific to JUnit 3, while @Test is specific to JUnit 4 and deprecates the former. It could be a good approach to remove this prefix and avoid redundancy. It is recommended to follow the Java naming conventions for method's names and remove the underscore characters. For test methods, the underscores can be replaced with BDD format.

        coaching: Coached IC today to continue manual scanning such errors of left over unused variables despite using UTGenerator till the time fix is made by AUT team. For now Resharper trial version could be used though however long term mitigation is to fix UTGenerator tool.

        unit: https://jira.devfactory.com/browse/TBGTM-6108
        coaching: Coached in CIC that in T-5108 the method Can Be Marked as Static. Improvement suggestion in this case is private static Set <String> getScreeningFields. Since this method is not using any instance variable, it could be a good idea to mark it as static as well. Static methods are ok when they are functions, i.e. they don't do any I/O, don't have any internal state and only use their parameters to compute their return value. This way the code can call this method even if no object was created yet.

        unit: https://jira.devfactory.com/browse/KMECN-28256
        coaching: This code uses a single-line to format statements, conditions, or code blocks. It could be a good idea to format the code using separate lines for statements, conditions, or code blocks (Single-line statement rule).This change would increase the readability of the code and will provide a clear picture of the algorithm.
