	    description: Process Improvements recommended by Java HUT team as follows to improvize the process by giving a reference of TBGTM-6075: Here variable should be used in asset part as well instead of literal values for all getters and setters and when we are assigning the values at same line and not modifying then set it as final. This can save approx.16 hours as it is taking too much to fix them and this impact is on every PR which was set up using AUT for Tradebeam where every Getter Setter has the same issue. Second process improvement recommendation is it never uses NotNullValue() function in assertion and it is suggested to use real value instead. It was given as a feedback to apply these changes in the PR https://github.com/trilogy-group/avolin-tradebeam-gtm/pull/989.
